# Node ||40

## Starter app

We have created a starter app that you can run and test. To use the app:

### 1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kintegrate/kin-starter-node.git
cd kin-starter-node
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the demo

```shell
yarn dev
```

## What's next?

You can read the [Getting Started - Node](/tutorials/node/) to read how you can integrate the `kin-node` SDK in your own apps.

If you have questions or want to talk about how to integrate Kin, please join our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/kdRyUNmHDn).
