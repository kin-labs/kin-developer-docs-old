excerpt: Learn what Kin is and how you can use it in your own App.
---

Welcome to the Kin Developer's Documentation. It contains everything required for App builders to understand the benefits of working with Kin and helps you get started with the process of building a Kin App, whether you're a developer or not.

## What is Kin?

Simply put, Kin is money for the digital world and it provides a way for developers (like you) to monetize their apps and websites in a fundamentally new way.

Kin exists as a token on Solana, a consumer-grade blockchain built for scale. Solana is fast, decentralized and secure, making it the perfect home for Kin. Read more at http://www.solana.com.
For more information about Kin, see here:

## Why should I develop with Kin?

The value proposition for building a Kin App is a simple one:

1. You can become part of a [thriving digitial economy](https://kin.org/kin-apps)
2. We provide an additional revenue stream to qualifying Apps via the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE) as well as grants. That's right, you can earn Kin by using Kin in your app.
3. We provide best-in-class developer tools to make building compelling blockchain apps as simple as possible, both for non-developers and developers alike.

## So I can earn Kin just by transacting with Kin?

That's exactly right! The [Kin Rewards Engine](/essentials/kin-rewards-engine/) (KRE for short) is a way for Kin to support the amazing apps in our ecosystem. You should definitely read about how it works and how you can make sure your App qualifies.
