## Giftery Vendor

Best of all, [Giftery Vendor](https://giftery.io/vendor) enables developers to easily integrate Giftery into their own App's experience and add a new array of options for their users to spend their Kin in-app. For Kin apps which participate in the KRE, in-app Giftery transactions will natively count towards your KRE metrics!

If you are a developer, integrating Giftery into your own App is as easy as signing up, embedding Giftery or connecting via the API, loading your account with USD/USDC and accepting payments with Kin. The Giftery dashboard allows you to track and query orders, analyze transaction data, add USD funds to your vendor account, and more!
