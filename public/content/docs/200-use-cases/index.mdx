Got a great App, but not sure how you could incorporate Kin into the experience? No, worries! Here's some examples of the ways Kin is used in our ecosystem that might help you get started.

## Transaction Types

Kin Use Cases are arranged around three types of transactions:<br/>

- **Spend** - A user spends Kin in your App. Woop!<br/>
- **Earn** - The App pays Kin out to a user. Great!<br/>
- **P2P** - Users send Kin to another user via the App. So supportive!

## Common Kin Use Cases

  <NavCard title="Real World Purchases" svgFile="cart-shopping-solid" useCase>
    **Spend Transaction** <br /> Buy real stuff! Allow your users to purchase products with Kin in your app.
