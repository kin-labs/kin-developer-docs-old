Built on the principles of fairness, efficiency, transparency and equal opportunity, the Kin Rewards Engine is how Kin rewards qualifying Apps by providing an additional revenue stream based on how much Kin is being transferred within that application.

## How The KRE Works

### Daily Payout

The KRE is awarded via a shared 'Daily Payout' that can be as high as 250,000,000 Kin.

Developers can increase their possible portion of the Daily Payout by simply encouraging their users to obtain and spend Kin

Those developers who create the biggest consumer demand and use for Kin receive the biggest daily rewards. There are controls put in place to promote fairness for newer/smaller apps that reduce the possibility of a monopoly.

Daily Payouts are sent to approved developers on a weekly basis.

### KRE Principles

The KRE has been developed based on the following principles:

**Fairness**

All developers are measured against the same metrics.

**Efficiency**

Payouts have been streamlined to be as quick and seamless as possible.

**Transparency**

The KRE formula is public and easy to understand.

**Equal Opportunity**

All developers are eligible to take part in and by rewarded by the KRE.

## Development of the KRE

The KRE is not fixed in stone, it continues to evolve over time to make sure it serves the Kin community as effectively as possible.

Anyone can contribute to the development of the KRE. Have your own ideas and want to submit your own Improvement Proposal? Find out how below:

</div>

## Ensuring Fairness

In order to prevent monopolies, we implement a 'Monopoly Clause' that prevents an App or specific combination of Apps from taking too much of the KRE.

  <NavCard
    title="The KRE Monopoly Clause"
    subtitle="See how the Monopoly Clause works"

      label: 'Learn more',
    }}
  />
</div>

Apps are regularly audited, manually and programmatically (via transaction data), to ensure they are creating positive user experiences, are improving the overall Kin ecosystem, and are meeting our [KRE Checklist](/docs/essentials/kre-checklist), [Developer Terms](https://kin.org/kin-developer-terms/), and [Terms of Use](https://kin.org/terms-and-conditions/) to remain eligible to receive rewards from the KRE.

If you have information about an App behaving in a way that contravenes our community standards, or have a question about your KRE payments, please get in touch via our fantastic Developer Discord.
