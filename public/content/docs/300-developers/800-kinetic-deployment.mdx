# Kinetic Deployment

## Deploying Kinetic to Heroku

Here we will show how you can deploy your own Kinetic Instance to Heroku.

### Fork Kinetic

Fork you own version of Kinetic that we'll use to deploy on Heroku

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Fork Kinetic"
    icon="github"
    link={{ url: 'https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/fork/', label: 'See the Repo' }}
  />
</div>

### Sign Up To Heroku

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Heroku Account"
    pngFile="heroku"
    link={{ url: 'https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/', label: 'Sign Up / Log In' }}
  />
</div>

### Create a new App

### Set your Environment Variables

Go to Settings / Config Vars and add your environment variables as you would have in your `.env` file when [running Kinetic locally](/developers/deployment/#prepare-your-environment-variables).<br/>
Make sure not to include quote marks around your strings as Heroku won't filter them out.<br/>

### Deploy Kinetic

Go to Deploy / Manual Deploy and deploy Kinetic. You can also choose to set up automatic deployment.

### Open your App

That's it! You should be good to go. Click 'Open app' to open the Kinetic Manager. Heroku has great options for viewing logs etc through the online console and also has a brilliant CLI if you want to go down that route.

### Configure Your Kinetic Instance

## Running Kinetic Locally

#### Requirements:

```shell
Node.js 14+
Docker 20+
Yarn v1.22+
```

#### Get Started

To get started with Kinetic, pull down the [Kinetic](https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic) repo and install dependencies.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kin-labs/kinetic.git
cd kinetic
yarn install
```

#### Prepare your Environment Variables

Kinetic is highly configurable, but don't worry, we've provided an example file you can use to get started quickly.<br/>
Just copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into your own `.env` file.<br/>
See the full list of environment variables <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/dev/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.

#### Make sure Docker is running

</div>

#### Run Kinetic Services

Then, in separate terminals, do each of the following:

- run the database

```shell
yarn dev:services:postgres
```

- prepare the database

```shell
yarn prisma migrate reset && yarn prisma db push
```

- run Solana locally (`localhost:8899`) or set `SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC_ENDPOINT=devnet` and skip this step

```shell
yarn dev:services:solana
```

- run the Kinetic API (`localhost:3000`)

```shell
yarn dev:api
```

- run the Kinetic Manager (`localhost:4400`)

```shell
yarn dev:admin
```

- run the Kinetic Demo App (`localhost:4200`)

```shell
yarn dev:demo
```

#### Open The Kinetic Manager

- Kinetic Manager is a full-featured GUI for Kinetic
- You can log in using the details set in your `.env` file.
- [Click here](http://localhost:4400) to open localhost:4400

#### Open The Kinetic Demo

- Use the built-in Kinetic Demo to test Kin transactions on your Kinetic instance
