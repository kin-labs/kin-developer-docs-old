## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with Kin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your App.

### Installation

```shell

```

### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

```

```

Don't have an App Index? Register your App on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

### Create Account

You can create accounts from existing mnemonics or secret keys. In this case we'll generate a mnemonic and use that to creat the keypair we use for creating the account on the blockchain.

```

```

### Check Balance

```

```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

```

```

### Transfer Kin

```

```

### Transfer Kin Batch

```

```

### Get Transaction Details

```

```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```

```

### Get Account History

```

```

### Webhooks

In [Kinetic Manager](/developers/kinetic-manager/), you can configure your App to use the following webhooks:

### Events Webhook

This webhook can be used to receive information about completed transactions.

E.g. In a node express server:

```js
app.use('/events', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body
  // DO STUFF WITH THE EVENT DATA
  res.sendStatus(200)
})
```

### Verify Webhook

This webhook can be used to verify transactions.

E.g. In a node express server return a `200` status code to approve the transaction:

```js
app.use('/verify', async (req, res) => {
  const transaction = req.body
  // CHECK THAT YOU WANT THIS TRANSACTION TO PROCEED
  // e.g.
  if (transaction.amount < 1000000) {
    res.sendStatus(200)
  }
  res.sendStatus(400)
})
```

## Demos and Starter Kits

Created to help get you up and running as quickly as possible, these projects can be a great reference point when you get stuck or even a starter for your own project. Happy coding!
