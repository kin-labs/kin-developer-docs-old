# Kin Essentials

Welcome to the Kin Developer's Documentation. It contains everything required for app builders to understand the benefits of working with Kin and helps you get started with the process of building a Kin app, whether you're a developer or not.
## What is Kin?

Kin is a token on Solana, a consumer-grade blockchain built for scale. Solana is fast, decentralized and secure, making it the perfect home for Kin. Read more at http://www.solana.com.

## Why Develop with Kin?

The value proposition for building a Kin app is a simple one:
1) We provide best-in-class developer tools to make building compelling blockchain apps as simple as possible, both for non-developers and developers alike.
2) We provide financial support to qualifying apps via the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE) as well as grants. That's right, you can earn Kin by using Kin in your app.

### So I can earn Kin just by transacting with Kin?
That's exactly right! The [Kin Rewards Engine](/essentials/the-kre-explained) (KRE for short) is a way for Kin to support the amazing apps in our ecosystem. You should definitely read about how it works and how you can make sure your app qualifies.
