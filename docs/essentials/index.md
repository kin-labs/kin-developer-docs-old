# Kin Essentials

Welcome to the Kin Developer's Documentation. It contains everything required for developers to get started with integrating their apps with Kin.

## What is Kin?

Kin is a token on Solana, a consumer-grade blockchain built for scale. It can currently handle 65,000 transactions per second, so it can scale as well as most financial payment systems. Solana transaction times are roughly less < 1 second, making it perfect for the consumer applications of all sizes. Currently transactions made via the Kin SDKs is closer to ~2 seconds, but is being optimized every day. Solana is also decentralized and secure. Read more at http://www.solana.com.

## Why Develop with Kin?

The value proposition of Kin is easy to explain.
1) We provide best-in-class developer tools to make building compelling blockchain apps as simple as possible.
2) We provide financial support to qualifying apps via the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE) as well as grants. That's right, you can earn Kin from the Kin Foundation by using Kin in your app.
