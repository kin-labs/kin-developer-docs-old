# KRE App Registration ||20

## Create an Account on the Kin Developer Portal

This will create your App and give you your all-important App Index. Your App Index is used to identify your transactions and make sure you get paid via the KRE.<br/><br/>

Congrats! Your App is now registered!



<!-- ## Configurable Options

After initial registration, the follow-up email will contain instructions on how to configure various options for their app. Below are descriptions of the options that can be configured when using Agora.

### Webhooks

The following options are configurable for developers interested in using [webhooks](/docs/how-it-works/#webhooks):

- **Webhook Secret**: Required for an App to make use of any [webhooks](/docs/how-it-works/#webhooks). This secret will be used by Agora to generate the `X-Agora-HMAC-SHA-256` [signature](/docs/agora-webhook-reference/#authentication) so that apps can verify the origin of the requests.
- **Sign Transaction URL**: The URL for Agora to send [Sign Transaction](/docs/how-it-works/#sign-transaction) webhook requests. Required to make use of the sign transaction webhook.
- **Events URL**: the URL for Agora to send [Events](/docs/how-it-works/#events) webhook requests. Required to make use of the events webhook. -->

## Updating Your Apps

If you update your App details (either Settings or Environments) in the [Kin Developer Portal](https://portal.kin.org/), make sure you let us know in the [dev-portal-support](https://discord.com/channels/808859554997469244/866647819913396224) channel on Discord so that we can update your App on our backend. If you don't, you might be missing out on your KRE rewards or not have your webhooks firing, etc.<br/><br/>
