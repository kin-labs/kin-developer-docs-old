## Are you ready?
Before moving your application onto the Mainnet, it's good practice to make sure you're able to transact on the Devnet. If it's all working how you want, then let's get going!


Need to have access to an instance of the Kinetic API.
2 Options:

Both
- Insights into transactions
- Insights into hot-wallet usage

Kin Hosting
- Restrictions apply
- Only Kin available, no other mints
- Kinetic version can be updated
- Limited logs availability (1 week)

How To
- Get a link on the Portal to your Kinetic API instance url that you can use to configure your Kinetic client.

Self Hosting
- Configure multiple mints
- Stay on a specific Kinetic version
- Unlimited log retention
- Configure multiple hot-wallets
- Customisable (Open Source)

How To
- Deploy your Kinetc API instance to e.g. Heroku
- Use Kinetic Manager UI to manage configuration

Finally, make sure you've applied to the KRE so you can earn for your transactions. Also apply for a grant!
