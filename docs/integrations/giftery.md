# Buy Modules

Buy Modules allow your users to purchase Kin (and other cryptocurrencies) directly inside your application with their credit or debit card. Woop!

This is great as it creates a more seamless experience for your users and keeps them within your lovingly tended walled-garden.

The options for Buy Modules are increasing all the time, but here are some that you can use to get started:

## Simplex
Buy Kin with Simplex [here!](https://kin.org/buy-kin/)

## Ramp
Buy Kin with Ramp [here!](https://ramp.network/buy/)

Here's a lovely [Ramp Android Demo](https://github.com/kin-labs/kin-android-ramp-demo).
