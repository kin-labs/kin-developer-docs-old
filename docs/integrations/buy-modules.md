# Buy Modules

Buy Modules allow your users to purchase Kin (and other cryptocurrencies) directly inside your application with their credit or debit card. Woop!

This is great as it creates a more seamless experience for your users and keeps them within your lovingly tended walled-garden.

The options for Buy Modules are increasing all the time, but here are some that you can use to get started:

## Simplex

Check out the Simplex docs [here](https://integrations.simplex.com/).

## Ramp
Buy Kin with Ramp [here!](https://ramp.network/buy/)

Find the Ramp docs [here](https://docs.ramp.network/).

Here's a lovely [Ramp Android Demo](https://github.com/kin-labs/kin-android-ramp-demo).

And here's an equally lovely [Ramp iOS Demo](https://github.com/kin-labs/kin-ios-ramp-demo).
