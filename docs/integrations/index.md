# Integrations

Welcome to the Kin Developer's Documentation. It contains everything required for developers to get started with integrating their apps with Kin.

### What is Kin?

Kin is a token on Solana, a consumer-grade blockchain built for scale. It can currently handle 65,000 transactions per second, so it can scale as well as most financial payment systems. Solana transaction times are roughly less < 1 second, making it perfect for the consumer applications of all sizes. Currently transactions made via the Kin SDKs is closer to ~2 seconds, but is being optimized every day. Solana is also decentralized and secure. Read more at http://www.solana.com.

### Where to Start

To effectively integrate the use of Kin into their apps, developers should first familiarize themselves with the high-level [architecture overview](/docs/architecture-overview/) and [how the system works](/docs/how-it-works/). Those who are ready to get started and register can jump to the [App Registration](/docs/app-registration/) section.

### Best Practices

Once you're ready to code, have a quick look at our [Developer Best Practices](/docs/best-practices) where we cover some useful topics that you'll want to keep in mind as you build out your Kin application.
